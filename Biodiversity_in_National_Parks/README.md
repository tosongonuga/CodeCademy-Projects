This repository contains the code and resources used to analyze biodiversity data from the ***U.S. National Parks Service***. The 
main goal of this project was to gain insights into the characteristics of the species and their conservation status, as well as 
the species' relationship with the various national parks using the frequency of their sightings.

The **"biodiversity.ipynb"** contains all the information and code for the project.

The **"observations.csv"** and **"species_info.csv"** are the original datatsets provided by ***Codecademy.com*** for this project.

The **"biodiversity.csv"** contains the cleaned and merged data derived from the original datasets provided.

### Introduction
Biodiversity, the variety of life forms on Earth, plays a pivotal role in maintaining the balance and resilience of ecosystems.
This project delves into the biodiversity data provided by the ***U.S. National Parks Service*** to analyze the endangerment status of species 
and their sightings within different parks.

Endangered species are living organisms that face the threat of extinction in their natural habitats. These species are at a critically low population level, 
often due to a combination of factors such as habitat loss, pollution, overexploitation, and climate change. The classification of a species as endangered indicates 
that it demands urgent attention and conservation efforts.

By analyzing and visualizing this data, we can identify trends and raise awareness about the need to protect wildlife found in the U.S. National Parks.
Preserving biodiversity not only ensures the survival of various species but also safeguards the health and resilience of all other interconnected ecosystems found in the parks.

### Data
The data for this project was sourced from the ***U.S. National Parks Service*** (https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/). It contains information about species occurrences and 
sightings across multiple national parks. The dataset includes details such as species names, conservation status, park name, and number of recorded sightings collected 
over a 7-day period. 

The sourced data was preprocessed and made available by ***Codecademy.com*** as part of the portfolio project offered on their Data Scientist Career Path. 
**The data used for this project is inspired by real data, but is mostly fictional.**
